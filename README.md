# Project Space - Bitcoin Wallet.

#### This is a private, web-based Bitcoin wallet application built primarily with Next.js 15. It prioritizes user control and privacy, designed to run with own **Bitcoin Core full node**.

_This project was developed through collaboration between developers and generative AI tools, including
`Grok AI`, `Gemini Pro`, `GitHub Copilot`, `ChatGPT`, `Claude AI`, `DeepSeek AI`, and `Windsurf`. I then
refined and optimized the code for enhanced performance._

### ‚ú® Features

Here are the initial features implemented, with more planned for future updates:

- **Secure Key Management**: Generate mnemonics, build custom derivation paths, and create `xpub` descriptors
  only for wallet accounts.
- **Transaction History**: View a clear and concise history of your Bitcoin transactions.
- **Send/Receive Functionality**: Easily send and receive Bitcoin directly from wallet.

## üöÄ Getting Started

More detailed setup instructions will be provided soon. In the meantime, here's a brief overview of what
you'll need:

1. **Bitcoin Core Full Node**: Ensure you have a synced _Bitcoin Core full node_ running, preferably
   configured to accept connections over _Tor_.

2. **PostgreSQL Database**: Set up a PostgreSQL database instance. For locally use _WSL2 Ubuntu_.

3. **Dependencies**: Install project dependencies using your preferred package manager, use one of them
   `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, Example using `bun`:

```bash
bun install
```

4. **Environment Variables**: Configure your environment variables for database connection, Bitcoin Core RPC,
   and Tor.

## üöÄ Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
bun run start:dev --port 8338
```

Open [http://localhost:8338](http://localhost:8338) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically
optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Setup pnpm (optional)

If you are using `pnpm`, you need to add the following code to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@heroui/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are
installed correctly.

## üì¶ Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
bun run build
```
